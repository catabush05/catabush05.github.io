                    <h2>who am I</h2>
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, I am a passionate storyteller, fan of the outdoors, and
                        devoted soccer enjoyer. I am currently a Junior at Willamette University, where I'm majoring in
                        Data Science and part of the club rugby team. My favorite poet is undoubtedly Sara Teasdale, and
                        my language of choice flipflops between Python, R, and Spanish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've worked with multiple clubs across various levels of American soccer — from USL League 2 to
                        MLS. I'm pursuing a career in the field and am always open to conversations regarding new
                        opportunities. I've also compiled a list of resources for those new to soccer analytics under
                        the "Resources" tab.

                <h2>my journey to soccer analytics</h2>
                <p style="display: inline;">
                    I can only credit one thing for truly introducing me to sport analytics: Syracuse University. During
                    my two years at the Falk College of Sport, I learned many of the hard skills I use today, but worth
                    even more was the mentorship and guidance I received that introduced me to this entire sphere. If
                    not for the people at Syracuse, I would not be doing any of this. In early 2024, I began playing
                    around with passing networks per a tutorial from
                </p>

                <p style="display: inline;">
                    which eventually led to creating single-graphic rudimentary MLS match reports in Python. Those
                    reports slowly ramped up and changed over time, and I quickly added new leagues as well. Over the
                    2024-25 offseason, I completely revamped the reports, automated the scripts, and turned my Bluesky
                    feeds into what they are today. Throughout that time, I continued to produce various other small
                    projects as time allowed. In April 2025, I set my sites on a new goal: creating a comprehensive
                    *free* data visualization platform using ASA data. After months and hundreds of hours of work, in
                    September of 2025, that became a reality — ASA VizHub. Between 2024 and now, I've worked with 4
                    clubs across 4 different leagues. My journey is nowhere near done, and I can't wait to see where
                    this all goes next!
